/// See p91TBi-6Cl-p2 for more information about the algorithm.
/// See pe5pgL-153-p2 for background about adding Analytics Hub interactions to the algorithm.

/// The UI should call `interacted` when these events happen:
///
/// - Scrolling (My Store or Analytics)
/// - Pull-to-refresh (My Store or Analytics)
/// - Tapping on the bars in the chart
/// - Changing the tab
/// - Navigating to the My Store tab
/// - Tapping on a product in the Top Performers list
/// - Tapping on the Analytics date range
/// - Selecting an Analytics date range option
/// - Tapping on "See Report" on an Analytics Hub card
///
/// If we ever change the algorithm in the future, we should probably consider renaming the Tracks event to avoid
/// incorrect comparisons with old events. We should also make sure to change the Android code if we're changing anything
/// in here. Both platforms should have the same algorithm so we are able to compare both.
