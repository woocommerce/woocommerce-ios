WooCommerce is excited to introduce the latest updates to its mobile app.

Refresh and Ready: Let’s say a user applies sorting parameters and/or filters to your store’s product list—chances are, when they return to the app, they don’t want to repeat that process. No problem! Now, if a user reopens the app, they’ll be able to see their previous settings.

Consolidation: The designated fulfillment screen is a thing of the past—fulfillment information now lives on the order details screen, as does info about fees. 

Bugs Be Gone: We’ve fixed several glitches—here’s a taste: 

- Billing information action sheets now present correctly on iPads. 
- Rows in product search lists no longer have double separators.
- Loading spinners on “continue” buttons are now visible in dark mode.
