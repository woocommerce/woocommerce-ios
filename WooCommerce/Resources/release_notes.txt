A short list of changes this time around:

- The order status label in the Order List no longer gets cut off, so you can actually see all the information.
- If you ever wondered why the Woo logo on the launch screen looked a little stretched out, its because the aspect ratio was wonky — that’s fixed now.
- For clarity, you’ll now see “Shipping Carrier” throughout the app instead of “Shipping Provider.”

Stay safe and wash your hands, everyone!
