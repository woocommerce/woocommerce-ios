The orders tab has gotten an update with this release. The tabs are now gone, and we’ve given you a filter by status or date range option. This is based upon your direct feedback over the years, and we know you’ll like the change!

We fixed a possible crash when creating a shipping label on an order from a push notification. We also improved the login experience with your password manager. Your stored username and password for WordPress.com in your manager will be at the top of the list!

As always, please continue to send us your feedback. Thanks for using WooCommerce!
