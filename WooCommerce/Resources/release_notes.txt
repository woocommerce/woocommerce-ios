We've made a few updates to improve your WooCommerce app experience! Now, you'll see custom amounts in their own section on order details for a cleaner look. We've added support for Universal Links in the woo.com domain, making it easier to navigate. Additionally, when adding a product/variation by scanning a barcode on the order form, only the exact SKU will be added for precision. Enjoy!
