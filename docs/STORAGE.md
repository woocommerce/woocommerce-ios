# Storage

> This module encapsulates the local persistence layer, and provides an implementation of that persistence layer based on CoreData.

## Public interface
The Storage module exposes its functionality via the [`StorageManagerType`](../Storage/Storage/Protocols/StorageManagerType.swift) protocol. 

This protocol declares getters to [`StorageType`](../Storage/Storage/Protocols/StorageType.swift) and methods to save or perform an operation on a `StorageType` 

## The CoreData stack
The default implementation of the `StorageManagerType` and `StorageType` protocols is based on CoreData.

 `StorageManagerType` is implemented by the [`CoreDataManager`](../Storage/Storage/CoreData/CoreDataManager.swift) class. As the name implies, this class manages a CoreData stack, aggregating a `NSPersistentContainer`.

When clients of this class request a `StorageType`, `CoreDataManager` will return an `NSManagedObjectContext`. 

When `CoreDataManager` is requested a  `viewContext`, it will provide  the persistent containerâ€™s `viewContext`. `viewContext` should only be used for reading and not writing.

`CoreDataManager` manages a single background context for write operations, which cannot be accessed directly. Instead, there are two versions of `performAndSave` methods to use for writing - depending on whether you need to send a result back to the completion closure. 
Note: For thread safety, do not send any `NSManagedObject` instance to the completion closure of `performAndSave`. There's an assertion to ensure at debug runtime this does not happen.

## File storage
The Storage module also exposes a protocol, called [`FileStorage`](../Storage/Storage/Protocols/FileStorage.swift) to abstract saving and reading data to and from local storage. 

The default implementation of this protocol, [`PListFileStorage`](../Storage/Storage/Tools/PListFileStorage.swift) provides support for `.plist` files.  

File storage is used mostly for [local app settings](app-local-settings.md).

## Model objects
This module also provides extensions to make the model objects declared in the `Networking` module coredata-compliant.  

That is achieved by extending the model objects declared in `Networking` to make them extend `NSManagedObject` and provide `@NSManaged` properties and CoreData compliant accessors to some of those properties. Those extensions can be generated directly inside Xcode.
