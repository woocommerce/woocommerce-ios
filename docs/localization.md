# Localization

During development, using [`NSLocalizedString()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocalizedstring) in the code should be enough. You shouldn't need to touch the `Localizable.strings` files manually.

During the release process, `NSLocalizedString` statements are scanned and stored in the `Localizable.strings` file. The file is then uploaded to [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.com/projects/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/) for translation. Before the release build is finalized, all the translations are grabbed from GlotPress and saved back to the `Localizable.strings` files.

## Use Unique Reverse-DNS Naming Style Keys

Use a unique reverse-DNS naming style for keys of localized strings (instead of using the English copy as key). This allows to avoid issues where the same word in English could need different translations based on context, or very long keys causing issues with some translation services.

```swift
// Do
let postBtnTitle = NSLocalizedString("editor.post.buttonTitle", value: "Post", comment: "Verb. Action to publish a post")
let postType = NSLocalizedString("reader.post.title", value: "Post", comment: "Noun. Describes when an entry is a blog post (and not story or page)"
```

```swift
// Don't
let postBtnTitle = NSLocalizedString("Post", comment: "Verb. Action to publish a post")
let postType = NSLocalizedString("Post", comment: "Noun. Describes when an entry is a blog post (and not story or page)"
```

## Always Add Comments

Always add a meaningful comment. If possible, describe where and how the string will be used. If there are placeholders, describe what each placeholder is. 

```swift
// Do
let title = String(format: NSLocalizedString(
    "reader.post.follow.successTitle",
    value: "Following %1$@",
    comment: "Notice title when following a site succeeds. %1$@ is a placeholder for the site name."
), siteName)
```

```swift
// Don't
let title = String(format: NSLocalizedString(
    "reader.post.follow.successTitle",
    value: "Following %1$@",
    comment: ""
), siteName)
```

Comments help give more context to translators.

## Always Use Positional Placeholders

Always include the positional index of parameters, even if you only have one placeholder in your string. For example, instead of using `%@` as the placeholder, use `%1$@` instead. Positional placeholders allow translators to change the order of placeholders or repeat them if necessary.

```swift
// Do
let title = NSLocalizedString(
    "notifications.review.description",
    value: "%1$@ left a review on %2$@",
    comment: "Title for a product review in Notifications." +
        " The %1$@ is a placeholder for the author's name." +
        " The %2$@ is a placeholder for the product name."
)
```

```swift
// Don't
let title = NSLocalizedString(
    "notifications.review.description",
    value: "%@ left a review on %@",
    comment: "Title for a product review in Notifications." +
        " The first placeholder is the author's name." +
        " The second placeholder is the product name."
)
```

## Do Not Use Variables

Do not use variables as the argument of `NSLocalizedString()` (neither for the key, the value or the comment). The string key, value and comment will not be automatically picked up by the `genstrings` tool which expects string literals.

```swift
// Do
let myText = NSLocalizedString("some.place.title", value: "This is the text I want to translate.", comment: "Put a meaningful comment here.")
myTextLabel?.text = myText
```

```swift
// Don't
let myText = "This is the text I want to translate."
myTextLabel?.text = NSLocalizedString("some.place.title", value: myText, comment: "Put a meaningful comment here.")
let myKey = "some.place.title"
myTextLabel?.text = NSLocalizedString(myKey, value: "This is the text I want to translate.", comment: "Put a meaningful comment here.")
let comment = "Put a meaningful comment here."
myTextLabel?.text = NSLocalizedString("some.place.title", value: "This is the text I want to translate.", comment: comment)
```

## Do Not Use Interpolated Strings

Interpolated strings are harder to understand by translators and they may end up translating/changing the variable name, causing a crash.

Use [`String.localizedStringWithFormat`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string/1414192-localizedstringwithformat) instead.

```swift
// Do
let year = 2019
let template = NSLocalizedString("mysite.copyrightNotice.title", value: "© %1$d Acme, Inc.", comment: "Copyright Notice")
let str = String.localizeStringWithFormat(template, year)
```

```swift
// Don't
let year = 2019
let str = NSLocalizedString("mysite.copyrightNotice.title", value: "© \(year) Acme, Inc.", comment: "Copyright Notice")
```

## Multiline Strings

For readability, you can split the string and concatenate the parts using the plus (`+`) symbol. 

```swift
// Okay
NSLocalizedString(
    "some.place.concatenatedDescription",
    value: "Take some long text here " +
    "and then concatenate it using the '+' symbol."
    comment: "You can even use this form of concatenation " +
        "for extra-long comments that take the time to explain " +
        "lots of details to help our translators make accurate translations."
)
```

Do not use extended delimiters (e.g. triple quotes). They are not automatically picked up.

```swift
// Don't
NSLocalizedString(
    "some.place.tripleQuotedDescription",
    value: """Triple-quoted text, when used in NSLocalizedString, is Not OK. Our scripts break when you use this."""
    comment: """Triple-quoted text, when used in NSLocalizedString, is Not OK."""
)
```

## Pluralization

GlotPress currently does not support pluralization using the [`.stringsdict` file](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LocalizingYourApp/LocalizingYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000171i-CH5-SW10). So, right now, you have to support plurals manually by having separate localized strings.

```swift
struct PostCountLabels {
    static let singular = NSLocalizedString("activity.post.title", value: "%1$d Post", comment: "Number of posts displayed in Posting Activity when a day is selected. %1$d will contain the actual number (singular).")
    static let plural = NSLocalizedString("activity.postList.title", value: "%1$d Posts", comment: "Number of posts displayed in Posting Activity when a day is selected. %1$d will contain the actual number (plural).")
}

let postCountText = (count == 1 ? PostCountLabels.singular : PostCountLabels.plural)
```

## Numbers

Localize numbers whenever possible. 

```swift
let localizedCount = NumberFormatter.localizedString(from: NSNumber(value: count), number: .none)
```
