In this update, we've prioritized improving our WooCommerce Mobile App experience. You can now delete and update product categories as part of the product editing flow. We've enhanced the In-Person Payments feature with better retry handling for failed transactions and protection against accidental double-charging in poor network conditions. Minor updates include editing product details from the order detail screen and an empty state design for the Tax Rate selector. Enjoy a more efficient WooCommerce app.
