In this update we've improved the order creation flows, fixed several bugs in the edit order flows, and fixed a problem when starting a Tap to Pay on iPhone payment.
We've also made it easier to understand the budgets for your Blaze ad campaigns, and added support for Blaze ad creation in locales which don't use Western Arabic numerals.
