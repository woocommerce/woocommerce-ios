ADD PRODUCTS
Create, group, and publish products directly from your iPhone or iPad. Capture your creativity in the moment – turn your ideas into products in seconds, or save them as drafts for later.

GET NOTIFIED
Never miss an order or a review. Keep that FOMO at bay by enabling real-time alerts – and listen out for that addictive “cha-ching” sound that comes with every new sale!

Scroll the summaries, or search by customer or order specifics. Tap into the details to see itemized billing, begin fulfillment, and change order status. Add notes to the order or email customers directly to follow up.

TRACK YOUR STATS
See which products are winning at a glance. Keep tabs on overall revenue, order count, and visitor data by week, month, and year. Knowledge = power!
