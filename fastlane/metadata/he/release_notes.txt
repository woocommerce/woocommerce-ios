You’ll find a handy-dandy payment link at the top of an order that hasn’t had a payment applied yet. Send that link to your customer, and they can pay for that order right from their phone or computer.

This is a great option to use with the new order creation feature! Create an order while a customer is standing in front of you, and then text them the payment link through your site. Awesome, right?

You’ll need to update to WooCommerce 6.4 or greater to get this option in the app.
